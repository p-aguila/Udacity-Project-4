# Udacity-Project-4
Data Wrangling Analysis from Twitter account @WeRateDogs

In this project given by Udacity, I gathered data from 3 different sources: a 'csv' file stored in the hard disk, a 'tsv' file stored in the cloud, and a 'json' file obtained from Twitter API.
Then I assessed the data looking for quality and tidiness issues, and applied the cleaning methodology (define the issue, code and test).
Finally I did an Exploratory Data Analysis looking for the most popular breeds of dogs, and a score with the most popular dogs based on a rating table, retweet and favorite count.
I used the packages Pandas, Numpy, Request, Tweepy, Matplotlib and Seaborn in a Jupyter Environment.
